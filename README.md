I have created an excel dashboard by following below given steps:
1. Importing the data.
2. Cleaning the raw data by removing duplicates, spaces and errors.
3.Creating the pivot table by selecting complete cell range and 
creating pivot charts such as column chart, line chart, pie chart.
4. Last step is creating dashboard on a different sheet and adding
5. slicer to filter the specific data.
